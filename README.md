# Welcome to &why's coding test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Env Variables
Please pull the environment variables from Vercel using the following command:
```
vc env pull --environment=production --yes
```
You need to have the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) installed globally and linked to the project with `vercel link`


## The task
You are tasked with building an interactive Cat grid.

You can find a [simple mock-up of the Cat grid in the figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QaAUTjri39HPaSUTEoMfWQ/Cat-Grid?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev)

Please keep in mind that the UI is not the focus of this task. Feel free to use component libraries to speed up development. We like any of the following:
* [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
* [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

Please use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Getting the data
Please query the cat data from the [Cat API](https://developers.thecatapi.com)

**Bonus points**: display the details of a specific breed in the overlay
```
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds/:breed_id
```

### Building the UI
Please review [the Cat grid mock-up in the figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QaAUTjri39HPaSUTEoMfWQ/Cat-Grid?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev) linked above. Please choose an appropriate breakpoint when switching between mobile and desktop layouts.

#### Mobile
On mobile, the cat grid features a headline and single row of cat cards. Clicking on a cat card triggers the overlay, displaying additional information about the selected breeed.

There are **no** filters on mobile

#### Tablet and above
On larger screens, the cat grid offers a filter bar next to the cat cards. Checking one of the filters should update the card grid. Clicking on a cat card triggers the overlay, displaying additional information about the selected breed.

Please distribute cards across columns as you see fit.

Bonus: When filtering results, we‚Äôd like to see an animation applied to the changes in the grid or the individual grid items. Decide on your own which aspects to animate and how to implement it. Ideally implemented using [motion](https://motion.dev/). For example, a card can have its opacity and `y` position animated when appearing and/or disappearing.


## Expected outcome
Please submit a PR with your implementation of the Cat grid. We'd expect a working deployment that we can preview in Vercel.

Thank you so much for taking the time to complete this task üôè
